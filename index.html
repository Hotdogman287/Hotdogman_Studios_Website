    <h3>How It All Started</h3>

    <p>During my first-grade year, I found myself feeling unchallenged and sought a creative outlet by crafting a book. This singular project evolved into a series of epic proportions, featuring the heroic Hotdogman as he valiantly battled crime and halted the nefarious plans of his arch-nemesis, Dr. Bad. Over time, I expanded the cast of characters, resulting in a complex web of individuals and a convoluted storyline.</p>

    <h3>The Name Throughout the years</h3>

    <p>The title of my literary endeavors underwent several transformations over the years. Initially, in the 1st grade, it was known simply as "Michael's Books." However, as other individuals joined me as illustrators and co-authors, we rebranded as "Action News 101." Unfortunately, this title felt awkward and was unsuitable for our works for an extended period. Subsequently, during a revitalization attempt, we modified it to "Hotdogman Comics." Ultimately, we opted for a more straightforward and streamlined title, "Hotdogman Studios", which we still use today.</p>

    <h3>Contributers</h3>

    <p>My journey to become a proficient bookmaker and an accomplished storyteller was enriched by several factors, including the valuable input of people and experiences.</p>
